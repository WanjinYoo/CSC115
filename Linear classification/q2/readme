For question 2,

a)
We initially practiced on double variable data
the results can be obtained by running the sec.py and opening the test.html file

b) 

First.1py will take values from regdata.
It will first print scaled values for GPA and years of experience.(X^0 = 1, x^1 = GPA, x^2 = Years of experience, Y = salary)
Next array that gets printed is sum of errors for each vector. As you can see, my values are decreasing, is illustrated in error.html.
The next line is final vector of w and the total number of iterations to find my final w
Gamma = 1 showed me the best learningRate based on error curv
